# Dog For A Day

Dog For A Day allows users to search for shelter dogs anywhere in the United States, view details on each dog, and make a reservation with that dog for a particular day.

This repository contains the backend of the project; the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/ryansperzel/dog-for-a-day-frontend)

### Frontend

The component-based **JavaScript** frontend was built with **React** and **Redux**. I used **Semantic UI React** along with custom **CSS** to style the frontend.

### Backend

The backend API was built with **Ruby on Rails**, and I used **PostgreSQL** for the database.
